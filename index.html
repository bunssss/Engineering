    <p> <b><u>9/2/2022</u></b> - Created an account on tinkercad.com and learned how to utilize its tools and shapes. The challenge of the day was to recreate a kitchen home appliance based on a google image in tinkercad with the most detail possible.</p>

    <p> <b><u>9/16/2022</u></b> - This week, we started building our Rube Goldberg Machine and on Friday our challenge was to make a paper boat and have it hold the most amount of weight without sinking in 5 minutes.</p>

    <p> <b><u>9/23/2022</u></b> - We finished building our Rube Goldberg Machine. Our main problems were the car getting stuck or the cup not pushing the car enough for it to go down the ramp. Our machine was also very unstable. It needed more of a foundation so that it wouldn't easily fall or sway too much to one side. We were able to somewhat fix it by adding lots of tape but it just barely holds up</p>

     <p> <b><u>9/30/2022</u></b> - We listened to a guest speaker named Steven, he worked at Western Digital and gave us some insight into Computer Engineering and what it's like in that career field. Afterwards, we began "dissecting" a laptop by taking it apart and labeling each part on a worksheet with different colors. On Friday, we skipped the challenge and just continued to disassemble and reassmble the laptop.</p>
